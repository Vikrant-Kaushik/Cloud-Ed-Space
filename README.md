# Cloud-Ed-Space
Cloud platform where different folders and sections will be created containing education contents in an interactive manner. 

# Project Tile: 
Cloud Ed-Space Service


## Problem Statement:
The basic need for any person’s  growth in any aspect is proper resources at the right point of time. Many times when a person wants to study something, he/she lacks in resources because of not being at the proper place or situation. Sometimes study materials for students or cooking tips/guides etc are not available. People are still facing issues in the education sector.


## Introduction:
In this era of rapidly increasing technology and greater competition in every sector, everyone, more precisely students , teachers and learners  needs most of their study resources at one place and at fingertips which is possible only through proper implementation and utilization of Cloud Technology and features. The “Cloud Ed-Space Service” project is an initiative to overcome several problems and be an effective solution. It will act as a cloud platform where different folders and sections will be created containing education contents in an interactive manner. Later on this platform could be made available for personalized data storage systems. 


## Benefits of deployment on Cloud:
* Simple & easy to use
* On demand (24/7) access to the resources
* Secure and scalable 
* No loss of time for students and needy
* Highly available
* Saves time and money

## Using Public Cloud for Deploying the final product:
Which public cloud platform is better for a particular use case depends on many factors, including the specific needs, requirements, and constraints of the organization in question. AWS and Azure are popular and feature-rich cloud platforms, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.
AWS has been around longer and has a larger market share, so it is often considered the more established and mature platform. AWS offers a wide range of services, including compute, storage, databases, analytics, and machine learning, as well as Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, and blockchain services. Its ecosystem of third-party tools and services is extensive, and its customers include startups, enterprises, and government organizations.Azure, on the other hand, has been developed with a strong focus on integrating with Microsoft's existing on-premises technologies, such as Windows Server and Active Directory, making it an appealing option for organizations that already use Microsoft products. Azure is also known for its strong support for containers and its investment in open-source technologies, including Kubernetes and Linux. Additionally, Azure offers a number of AI and machine learning services, as well as Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain services.
Ultimately, the choice between AWS and Azure will depend on a variety of factors, including the specific needs and requirements of the organization, as well as budget, available skills, and existing infrastructure and technology investments. Both platforms offer a range of tools and services that can support the needs of organizations of all sizes and across a variety of industries, so it's important to carefully evaluate your options and do thorough research to determine the best solution for your organization.
According to my needs and requirements, Azure is a better option to choose due to its flexible deployment options, robustness, integration with Microsoft products and cost effectiveness.


## Architectural Style:
The architectural style of a Cloud-Ed Service would be MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data). The MIMD Architecture includes parallel architectures made of multiple processors and multiple memory modules linked via some interconnection network. In the cloud ed service the users give different instructions at the same time and get desired results simultaneously which is the property of MIMD architecture. The server is responsible for managing the consistency and integrity of the data, and clients can access the data from any location as long as they have an internet connection.
 It allows multiple users to access and modify the same data simultaneously, while each user's device executes its own set of instructions on its own data. This makes it possible for multiple users to collaborate on an educational platform  in real-time and access the data simultaneously. The changes made by the administrator will immediately  be reflected for all other users who have access to those contents or folders.
